workflow:
queries -> schedule

needs:
- once material is placed, don't replace it. Causes loops. Temporary query instead.

operations:
- place potentials with most pressure.
- When all possible queries are placed and some potentials are left, throw exception. New provider query is pushed. Can now be placed thanks to user state potential.
- two ways to provide: provider depends on needed task; needed task depends on provider.
- tasks with zero potential have pressure of -1 instead of +Infinity.
- task potential = intersection of query potential (internal constraints) + query dependencies + user state potential + materials.
- impossible to place (material time) => throw exception. (conflict)

when the stream complete without error, it should be the final timeline.

schedule (tasks (materials)):
- tasks (potentials)

tasks (potentials):
- queries
- tasks (potentials)
- tasks (materials)
- user state (potentials)
- user state (materials)

user state (material):
- initial user state
- tasks (materials) with needs

user state (potential):
- initial user state
- tasks (potentials) with needs

tasks with needs:
- tasks (materials)
- agent service

Stream:
1. agent queries
2. user interaction
3. [1, 2] queries
4. [3, 5] queries with temp
5. [4, 5, 7] tasks (potential) - use user-state function on tasks (potential & material)
7. [5] tasks (material)
9. [7] needs and fixes, placeholder fill or validate

a. Catch errors from [7] => generate new queries at [1].

Module:
[1] queries-fn
[2, 3] main app
[4, 5, 7] queries-scheduler
userstate-manager
[a] conflic-resolver
[b] agent-relay

Module a: if provider is impossible to place, either there is no need for it, or there is a conflict. Use user-state to determine.
userstate-manager: query + (potential/material) with needs + config + base needs => ranges of possibilities
